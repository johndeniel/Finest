## Introduction

Provide a brief introduction to the importance of data structures and algorithms in programming. Discuss how efficient algorithms and appropriate data structures can significantly impact the performance of programs.

## Big O Notation

Explain what Big O notation is and how it's used to analyze the time and space complexity of algorithms. Provide examples of different complexity classes (O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), O(n^2), etc.).

## Arrays

Explain the concept of arrays and their use cases. Include information on one-dimensional and multi-dimensional arrays, indexing, and common operations.

## Linked Lists

Discuss linked lists, their types (singly linked, doubly linked, circular), and their advantages over arrays. Cover insertion, deletion, and traversal operations.

## Stacks

Explain stacks, their LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) nature, and practical applications. Provide code examples for implementing basic stack operations.

## Queues

Introduce queues, their FIFO (First-In-First-Out) nature, and how they are used in various scenarios. Include examples of implementing queues.

## Hash Tables

Discuss hash tables (hash maps), their key-value structure, and how they achieve fast data retrieval. Explain collision resolution techniques and provide code examples.

## Trees

Cover binary trees, binary search trees, and balanced trees (AVL, Red-Black). Explain tree traversals (in-order, pre-order, post-order) and basic operations like insertion and deletion.

## Graphs

Introduce graphs and their components (vertices and edges). Discuss different types of graphs (directed, undirected) and common graph traversal algorithms (DFS, BFS).

## Sorting Algorithms

Explain various sorting algorithms such as bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort, and their time complexities. Provide code examples for each.

## Searching Algorithms

Cover linear search and binary search algorithms. Explain their principles, time complexities, and when to use each. Include code implementations.

## Dynamic Programming

Discuss dynamic programming as an optimization technique for solving problems with overlapping subproblems. Provide examples and explain the concept of
